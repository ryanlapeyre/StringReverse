# StringReverse
A short program that reverses a string given from the user. 
We malloc for a pointer, manipulate it, and free it. Using the stringLength function built, we can put a null terminating character "\0" at the end of our string as a precaution. 


Notes: used C because it'a language I'm familiar with. I need to learn Python and implement this just to see how it'd work. I imagine an array with a "for each" loop.
